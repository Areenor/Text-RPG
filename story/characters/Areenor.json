The path to the sanctuary is locked, but I can hear some ritual going over there. Rest of our group went down to dungeon to find another way in. There is wounded friend of yours in the living quarters, he might have some armor and a weapon for you. Check how he is feeling but first grab the healthPotion for him which I left in the library.
